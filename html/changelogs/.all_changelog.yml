      the gun while firing. It will cost gangs 50 influence.
  - rscadd: The sawn-off improvised shotgun is now available to gangs for 6 influence.

      but its duration is halved if the binding is not being pulled by a Servant.

      to pull the binding. If you are pulling the binding, you can dispel it at any

      with a slab, not just the initiator.

  Skylar Lineman, your local R&D moonlighter:
  - rscadd: Research has been completely overhauled into the techweb system! No more
      levels, the station now unlocks research "nodes" with research points passively
      generated when there is atleast one research server properly cooled, powered,
      and online.
  - rscadd: R&D lab has been replaced by the departmental lathe system on the three
      major maps. Each department gets a lathe and possibly a circuit imprinter that
      only have designs assigned by that department.
  - rscadd: The ore redemption machine has been moved into cargo bay on maps with
      decentralized research to prevent the hallways from becoming a free for all.
      Honk!
  - balance: You shouldn't expect balance as this is the initial merge. Please put
      all feedback and concerns on the forum so we can revise the system over the
      days, weeks, and months, to make this enjoyable for everyone. Heavily wanted
      are ideas of how to add more ways of generating points.
  - balance: You can get techweb points by setting off bombs with an active science
      doppler array listening. The bombs have to have a theoretical radius far above
      maxcap to make a difference. You can only go up, not down, in radius, so you
      can't get 6 times the points with 6 TTVs. The algorithm is exponentially/logarithmically
      scaled to prevent "world destroyer" bombs from instantly finishing research.
  SpaceManiac:
  - bugfix: HUDs from mechs and helmets no longer conflict with HUD glasses and no
      longer inappropriately remove implanted HUDs.

  - rscdel: All existing healing symptoms have been removed in favour of new ones.
  - rscdel: Weight Even and Weight Gain have been removed, so hunger can be used for
      balancing in symptoms.
  - rscadd: Starlight Condensation heals toxin damage if you're in space using starlight
      as a catalyst. Being up to two tiles away also works, as long as you can still
      see it, but slower.
  - rscadd: Toxolysis (level 7) rapidly cleanses all chemicals from the body, with
      no exception.
  - rscadd: 'Cellular Molding heals brute damage depending on your body temperature:
      the higher the temperature, the faster the healing. Requires above-average temperature
      to activate, and the speed heavily increases while on fire.'
  - rscadd: Regenerative Coma (level 8) causes the virus to send you into a deep coma
      when you are heavily damaged (>70 brute+burn damage). While you are unconscious,
      either from the virus or from other sources, the virus will heal both brute
      and burn damage fairly quickly. Sleeping also works, but at reduced speed.
  - rscadd: Tissue Hydration heals burn damage if you are wet (negative fire stacks)
      or if you have water in your bloodstream.
  - rscadd: Plasma Fixation (level 8) stabilizes temperature and heals burns while
      plasma is in your body or while standing in a plasma cloud. Does not protect
      from the poisoning effects of plasma.
  - rscadd: Radioactive Resonance gives a mild constant brute and burn healing while
      irradiated. The healing becomes more intense if you reach higher levels of radiation,
      but is still less than the alternatives.
  - rscadd: Metabolic Boost (level 7) doubles the rate at which you process chemicals,
      good and bad, but also increases hunger tenfold.
  kevinz000:
  - bugfix: Cryo cells can now be properly rotated with a wrench.
  ninjanomnom:
  - rscadd: 'You can now make a new tasty traditional treat: butterdogs. Watch out,

      to <50, and severe is 50+.
  - balance: Clockwork magicks will now prevent Bags of Holding from being combined

      and draw from an internal power cell to maintain it until either the cell dies
      (usually after 10 minutes) or power is restored.
  - rscadd: You can override emergency light functionality from an APC. You can also
      click on individual lights as a cyborg or AI to override them individually.

      burn!
  MrPerson & ninjanomnom:
  - refactor: Completely changed how keyboard input is read.
  - rscadd: Holding two directions at the same time will now move you diagonally.
      This works with the arrow keys, wasd, and the numpad.
  - tweak: Moving diagonally takes twice as long as moving a cardinal direction.
  - bugfix: You can use control to turn using wasd and the numpad instead of just
      the arrow keys.
  - rscdel: 'Some old non-hotkey mode behaviors, especially in relation to chatbox
      interaction, can''t be kept with the new system. Of key note: You can''t type
      while walking. This is due to limitations of byond and the work necessary to
      overcome it is better done as another overhaul allowing custom controls.'
  Robustin:
  - rscdel: Reverted changes in 3d sound system that tripled the distance that sound
      would carry.

  XDTM:
  - rscadd: 'Brain damage has been completely reworked! remove: Brain damage now no
      longer simply makes you dumb. Although most of its effects have been shifted
      into a brain trauma.'
  - rscadd: Every time you take brain damage, there's a chance you'll suffer a brain
      trauma. There are many variations of brain traumas, split in mild, severe, and
      special.
  - rscadd: Mild brain traumas are the easiest to get, can be lightly to moderately
      annoying, and can be cured with mannitol and time.
  - rscadd: Severe brain traumas are much rarer and require extensive brain damage
      before you have a chance to get them; they are usually very debilitating. Unlike
      mild traumas, they require surgery to cure. A new surgery procedure has been
      added for this, the aptly named Brain Surgery. It can also heal minor traumas.
  - rscadd: 'Special brain traumas are rarely gained in place of Severe traumas: they
      are either complex or beneficial. However, they are also even easier to cure
      than mild traumas, which means that keeping these will usually mean keeping
      a mild trauma along with it.'
  - rscadd: Mobs can only naturally have one mild trauma and one severe or special
      trauma.
  - balance: Brain damage will now kill and ruin the brain if it goes above 200. If
      it somehow goes above 400, the brain will melt and be destroyed completely.
  - balance: Many brain-damaging effects have been given a damage cap, making them
      non-lethal.
  - rscdel: The Unintelligible mutation has been removed and made into a brain trauma.
  - rscdel: Brain damage no longer makes using machines a living hell.
  - rscadd: Abductors give minor traumas to people they experiment on.

      ghosts as the Eminence from the eminence spire structure on Reebe.
  - rscadd: The Eminence is incorporeal and invisible, and directs the entire cult.
      Anything they say is heard over the Hierophant network, and they can issue commands
      by middle-clicking themselves or different turfs.
  - rscadd: The Eminence also has a single-use mass recall that warps all servants
      to the Ark chamber.
  - rscadd: Added traps, triggers, and brass filaments to link them. They can all
      be constructed from brass sheets, and do different things and trigger in different
      ways. Current traps include the brass skewer and steam vent, and triggers include
      the pressure sensor, lever, and repeater.
  - rscadd: The Eminence can activate trap triggers by clicking on them!
  - rscadd: Servants can deconstruct traps instantly with a wrench.
  - rscdel: Mending Mantra has been removed.

      yellow scriptures are for construction, red for offense, blue for defense, and
      purple for niche.
  - balance: Servants now spawn with a PDA and black shoes to make disguise more feasible.
  - balance: The Eminence can superheat up to 20 clockwork walls at a time. Superheated
      walls are immune to hulk and mech punches, but can still be broken conventionally.
  - balance: Clockwork walls are slightly faster to build before the Ark activates,
      taking an extra second less.
  - bugfix: Poly no longer continually undergoes binary fission when Ratvar is in
      range.
  - code_imp: The global records alert for servants will no longer display info that
      doesn't affect them since the rework.

  - rscadd: The drone dispenser on Box Station has been moved from the Testing Lab
      to the Morgue/Robotics maintenance tunnel.
  deathride58:
  - config: The default view range can now be defined in the config. The default is
      15x15, which is simplified to 7 by BYOND. For reference, Goonstation's widescreen
      range is 21x15. Do note that changing this value will affect the title screen.
      The title screen images and the title screen area on the Centcom z-level will
      have to be updated if the default view range is changed.
2017-12-08:

  - tweak: defib shock/charge sounds upped from 50% to 75%.
2017-12-11:
  Anonmare:
  - bugfix: Booze-o-mats have beer
  Cruix:
  - tweak: The white ship navigation computer now takes 10 seconds to designate a
      landing spot, and users can no longer see the syndicate shuttle or its custom
      landing location. If the white ship landing location would intersect the syndicate
      shuttle or its landing location, it will fail after the 10 seconds have elapsed.
  Frozenguy5:

  - bugfix: you no longer see space in areas you normally can't see, instead of black.
      in reality you can still see space but it's faint enough that you can't tell
      so I'll say I fixed it.
  uraniummeltdown:

  Robustin:
  - rscadd: Blood magic. The next generation of talismans - you can create 2 spells
      without a rune, up to 5 with a rune of empowerment. Preparing spells without
      a rune will cost a significant amount of blood. Every talisman has been rebalanced
      for its spell form. With a few exceptions, blood magic exists as a "touch" spell
      that is very similar in behavior/appearance to the wizard touch spells.
  - rscadd: New UI system for cultists.
  - rscdel: Removed talismans, Talisman Creation Rune replaced by Rune of Empowerment.
      Supply talisman has been replaced by a ritual dagger and 10 runed metal.

      get a mirror shield.
  - rscadd: 'The mirror shield, it blocks, it reflects, it creates illusions, and

      Shotgun slugs, .357 rounds, and other high damage projectiles will instantly
      shatter it and briefly stun the holder.'
  - balance: Nar'sien Bolas will not longer ensnare cultists and non-cultists will
      ensnare themselves when attempting to use them. The bolas are now comparable
      in effectiveness with reinforced bolas.
  - rscadd: Rune of Spirits. This merges the Spirit Sight and Manifest Ghost rune.
      The user will now choose which effect when invoking.
  - rscadd: The Spirit Sight function has received several major improvements, allowing
      the ghost to commune with the cult and mark objects similar how the cult master
      can. The user has a unique appearance while ghosted and manifested cult ghosts
      can see ghosts as well - allowing their summoner to lead them from the spirit
      realm.
  - balance: The Form Barrier rune will now last significantly longer and examining
      the rune as a cultist will tell you how long it will remain.
  - rscadd: The Apocalypse Rune. Replaces the EMP runes. Has a fixed invoker requirement
      and added usage limitations.  It scales depending on the crew's strength relative
      to the cult. Effect includes a massive EMP, unique hallucination for non-cultists,
      and if the cult is doing poorly, certain events. The rune can only occur in
      the Nar-Sie ritual sites and will prevent Nar-Sie from being summoned there
      in the future.

  - balance: The hallucination spell now has multiple charges.
  - tweak: The teleport spell can now be used on other adjacent cultists.
  - tweak: Summon Tome and Summon Armor have been combined into "Summon Equipment",
      which lets you choose between summoning a Ritual Dagger or Combat Gear (same
      loadout that Summon Armor used to provide).
  - balance: Standard cult robes now have -10 melee and -10 laser armor.
  - balance: The "Construction" spell will now convert airlocks into cult airlocks
      and cyborgs (after ~10 seconds) into constructs. The airlock is the most fragile
      in the game, with reduced integrity, armor, and render it vulnerable to most
      attacks. Cyborg "reconstruction" will be accompanied by an obvious effect/sound.
  - rscadd: Blood Rites. This spell allows you to absorb blood from your surroundings
      or adjacent non-cultists. You can use the blood rites as a convenient heal (self-healing
      is significantly more costly though) or you can try to gather large quantities
      of blood for unique and powerful relics.
  - rscadd: Blood spear, a fragile but robust spear with a special recall ability
  - rscadd: Blood bolts, the cultist's version of arcane barrage. The bolts will infuse
      cultists with unholy water and damage anything else.
  - rscadd: Blood beam, the ultimate blood rite. After a channeling period it will
      fire 12 powerful beams across a long distance, piercing almost any surface (except
      blessed turf), and damaging all non-cult life caught in the beam.

      than before.

      ratio was reduced to 20% to compensate for the increased volume and damage.
  - balance: Holy water will purge any and all blood spells from cultists.
  - rscadd: Artificers, Wraiths and Juggernauts can now scribe revive, teleport, and
      barrier runes respectively with a 3 minute cooldown.
  - balance: Juggernauts' forcewall is now 3x1 but it has a ~30% longer cooldown.
      Juggernauts got a modest speed increase (2.5 from 3) but lost a modest amount
      of HP (200 from 250).
  - rscadd: Juggernauts now get a ranged attack "Gauntlet Echo", a single projectile
      that moves about as fast as them and does 30 damage with 5 seconds of stun and
      a 35s cooldown.
  - balance: The number of ghosts summonable by the manifest spirit rune is 3, down
      from 5.
  - balance: It now takes ~20% less water (~25 units) and ~30 seconds less to deconvert
      cultists via holy water.
  - tweak: The emagged library console will now distribute ritual daggers.
  - tweak: Using the dagger on a rune will now take a 1-second channel to destroy
      it, to avoid incidents where people instantly wipe a critical rune by accident.
  - balance: Standard runed airlocks now have a lower damage deflection so they can
      be destroyed with most respectable melee weapons (10+).
  - balance: Teleporter runes that are used from space or lavaland will result in
      the destination rune giving off a unique effect for 60 seconds. This effect
      includes a long distance (but not obvious antagonistic) sound, a bright lighting
      effect, and a visual cue that will indicate where the cultist arrived from.

      walls, and hold defibrillators for public use. You can swipe an ID to clamp
      the defibrillator in place, and it will automatically draw from the powernet

      force and resist of 100, and a pull force of 101. Things take (resist - force)
      damage when bumped into experimental; Failing to move onto a tile will now still
      bump up your last move timer. However, successfully pushing something out of

      as Hivemind Hosts, have appeared onboard the station and must assimilate as
      many crew members as possible. Assimilated crew serve as vessels for the Host
      to use their powers through (and on), and as a Host gains vessels, they gain
      new abilities. remove: Vessels are not antagonists. Assimilation does not convert
      crew in any way.'
  - rscadd: Assimilated crewmembers can escape this nightmare by either getting a
      mindshield implant or by dying. Mindshielding vessels will reveal the identity
      of whoever assimilated them. Mindshielded crew are initially protected, but
      should a Host get strong enough, they can break these implants with ease.
  - rscadd: Nothing is stopping Hosts from working together, but as their hives grow,
      so does the incentive to backstab. At 8 vessels, Hosts can probe the minds of
      crew and discover the identity of any other Hosts who have assimilated them,
      and at 18, they can steal every single vessel from a captured enemy Host.

  actioninja\memager:

      objectives have been removed from the mode.'
  - tweak: Powers have been reorganized and are now unlocked in batches every five

      phases due to each batch affecting a specific area of the host's ability.

      and must be strengthened by using Network Invasion. Each time a host is detected

      random vessels into antagonists with a single, customizable objective.
  - rscadd: 'Circadian Shift is a late-game power that sends everybody in sight to
      sleep for up to almost a minute. The more people affected, the less time it
      lasts, the minimum being eight seconds. remove: Mass Assimilation has been removed
      as Reclaim now fills its role.'

      after assimilation.
  - tweak: Hive Sight also lets you hear what the vessel does.

  - balance: Induce Panic and Distortion Field have been buffed to be more reliable,
      especially at lower hive sizes.
  - balance: 'Induce Panic and Circadian Shift can affect silicons but no longer affect

  Manly Dwarf:
  - rscadd: Traitors can now set their uplink of choice to the Syndie-Lad, a portable
      arm mounted computer that tracks objectives and stores your uplink. Equipping
      it and pressing C will open the radial menu, or just hold it in your hand and
      press Z (assuming you're on hotkey mode). It also explodes, if you really need
      it to.
  - tweak: I currently don't have any good ideas for as to why you'd want to wear
      it instead of just hiding it in your backpack and using the pinpointer, so as

      again.
  - refactor: For NO REASON AT ALL I feel like reminding you all that you can buy
      a Voice Changer from the Chameleon Kit, and for some strange reason a coder
      made it cost 4 TC. Reverted. It doesn't even come with a spare ID that lets
      you fake your identity, that has to be purchased separately, and the shoes aren't
      noslips. Has no reason to be 4 TC on its own.

  - rscadd: I used the shotgun. You know why? Cause the shot gun doesn't miss, and
      unlike the shitty hybrid taser it stops a criminal in their tracks in two hits.
      Bang, bang, and they're fucking done. I use four shots just to make damn sure.
      Because, once again, I'm not there to coddle a buncha criminal scum sucking
      losers, I'm there to 1) Survive the fucking round. 2) Guard the armory. So you
      can absolutely get fucked. If I get unbanned, which I won't, you can guarantee
      I will continue to use the shotgun to apprehend criminals. Because it's quick,
      clean and effective as fuck. Why in the seven hells would I fuck around with
      the disabler shots, which take half a clip just to bring someone down, or with
      the tazer bolts which are slow as balls, impossible to aim and do about next
      to jack shit, fuck all. The shotgun is the superior law enforcement weapon.
      Because it stops crime. And it stops crime by reducing the number of criminals
      roaming the fucking halls.
